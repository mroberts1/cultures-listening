How is that different from how people listened to it a decade ago? A generation ago? A century ago? Why listen to music at all? This course provides an introduction to how to listen to music, and sound more generally, in a digital age of playlists and short attention spans. Rather than a traditional music-appreciation course, however, it focuses on listening itself as a cultural practice of the modern age. Topics include easy listening, hi-fi, and stereo in 1950s suburbia; jukeboxes and the rise of popular music; multitrack recording and headphone music in the 60s; portable listening from the Sony Walkman to the Apple iPod; elevator music, and ubiquitous listening; field recording and acoustic ecology; audiophile culture and the vinyl revival; streaming media and the playlist. Each class will be structured around relevant reading materials and a collective listening session and discussion. The course’s objective is to develop an understanding of listening as a deeply cultural practice, and to teach us to listen more attentively to the sounds of the world around us.\n\n\nInstructor Bio\nDr. Martin Roberts holds a Ph.
